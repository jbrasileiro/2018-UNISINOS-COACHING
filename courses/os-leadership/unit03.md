Unit 3: Developing Productivity Rituals
We are creatures of habit and as a result, rituals are a powerful way to act in accordance with our values and priorities. Rituals create structure in our lives and help us manage the infinite demands on our time. The most important role of a ritual is to help balance the expenditure of energy with energy renewal.

To help you achieve integration in the four aspects of your life it is necessary to develop “good habits”, which can be considered “productivity rituals”. As described by Tony Schwartz, productivity rituals are behaviors done at precise times that eventually become automatic. Because they are automatic, they do not take extra thought and do not deplete our energy resources.
