Unit 2: Achieving Integration Between Work and the Rest of Your Life

According to Stew Friedman, Professor of Management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and Director, Wharton Work/Life Integration Project, striving for work-life balance is futile. It’s a misguided metaphor because it assumes we must always make trade-offs among the four main aspects of our lives: work, home, community, and self. A more realistic and more gratifying goal is seeking to have better integration between work and the rest of life.

A key take away of the video, “Be a Better Leader, Have a Richer Life”, is the suggestion to take the time for introspection, reflection, discussion with others and finding that gap between who are you and who you want to be.

Four Domains Exercise

Stew Friedman suggests that the idea that “work” competes with “life” ignores the fact that life is actually the intersection and interaction of four domains: 1) work, 2) family, 3) community, and 4) self. While it may not be possible to enjoy complete contentment in all four domains at the same time. Conflict and stress are not inevitable. Harmony is possible.
