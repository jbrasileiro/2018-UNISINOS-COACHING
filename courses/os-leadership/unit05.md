Unit 5: Asking for and Receiving Feedback

#Video
Receiving feedback is a challenge for most of us. In the video, “How to use others feedback to learn and grow”, Sheila Heen points out there is tension between wanting to grow and wanting to be accepted the way we are. Receiving feedback well doesn’t mean that you have to immediately take the feedback as truth. Receiving it well means engaging in the conversation skillfully, and making thoughtful choices about whether and how to use the information you’re learning about yourself.

When we have a growth mindset we actively seek feedback. Feedback-seeking behavior has been linked to higher job satisfaction, greater creativity on the job, faster adaption in a new organization or role, and lower turnover. As you listen to Dr. Heen’s video, reflect on what is more important to you, the need to grow or the need to be accepted and respected the way you are now.

Download the “Guide to having a feedback discussion”, answer the questions in the guide and prepare yourself for your next feedback meeting. Schedule a meeting with two people that you trust. A peer, manager, coach, mentor or sponsor. Share with them your preferences in receiving feedback. Discuss what you believe are your top strengths and ask for their feedback. Review the results of your 360 (if you have a current one). After your meeting, reflect on how you handled receiving the feedback. Did you agree or disagree with the feedback? What did you learn from the feedback? How can you be better prepared for your next feedback meeting?
